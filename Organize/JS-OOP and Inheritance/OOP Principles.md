## Metadata
- Up:: [[JS-OOP and Inheritance]]
## Purpose
## Scope
#### 1. Abstraction

- Hide the details and show the essentials

#### 2. Inheritance

- ![[Pasted image 20230310113854.png]]
- JS-constructors- [[O-JS Object]]
- JS-prototype chain-[[Prototype Chain]]
  - The prototype chain's behavior is less like inheritance and more likeÂ **delegation**.
- JS-[[ES6 Class]]
  - a syntac sugar
  - not a new way of combining objects
  - just a way to make it easier to set up a prototype chain
- Class-based OOP

#### 3. Encapsulation

#### 4. Polymorphism

- when a method has the same name but a different implementation in different classes

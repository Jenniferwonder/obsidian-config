## Reflection
#### 1. Why is it hard to stay focused?
Till [[2023-01-31]], I've spent- 
- 3 days on [[JavaScript]] reflection
- 3 days on learning [[React]]
- 9 days on [[English Learning]] trying out ways to improve my spoken English while learning front-end technology 
- 1 day on [[Figma]] 
- 9 days spending [[2023 Spring Festival Holidays]] with my family 
- 2 days on reflection
	- [[Video Editing]]
	- [[How I Stay Focused and Improving Learning Efficiency]] 
- 1 day back on [[React]]  
I can see how ambitious I am.  
Even though at the beginning of this month I set a goal to learn and master **React** mainly this month, I still end up spending a considerable amount of time thinking about how to be able to **speak English like a professional**.  
I know how much my time cost, but I still want to be truly good at what I'm capable of - English and be able to make value out of  it.  
With that being concerned, it does make sense to build and enhance the following skills:
- English writing and speaking
	- Recording Videos  
	- Writing Blogs
	- Social Media
- Photo and video editing  
**But** there has to be a **focus** in terms of what I truly want to share.  
#### 2. Why should I stay focused?
Currently, if what I care is to be able to work as **a front-end engineer** with an English major background, what I truly need to think about is the requirement for a front-end engineer rather than the one for an English major. So here are the questions:
- **Why** do I want to work as a front-end engineer? 
- What do I want to do with the skills I'm learning?  
In the end, my goal is to be able to **enjoy my life**, and **make value** out of things I enjoy doing and find meaning from.  
In this sense, I should be doing  
I need to **be more focused**, because time is limited but skills are endless. I can only expect to excel in one aspect first then seek to achieve more.  
So if I am serious about finding a job as soon as possible as a front-end engineer, work hard and attentively on learning and improving your programming skills. Anything else is merely distraction.  
There's nothing wrong about sharing, but if you want to make good impact and truly benefit people with what you share, wait till you have **acquired the skills** that can make enough money to support yourself, wait till your **note** is good enough.

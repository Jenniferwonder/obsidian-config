What do you want to learn? Why?
- I want to make the best use of the skills I have 
	- to do something interesting or meaningful
	- to bring value to the world in a more effective way  
**Who** do you want to benefit from your service or content?  
What do they **need**?  
What can **you** offer to them?  
What's the **structure** of the content or service you prepare to offer?  
**Who** are your role models? **What** did they do? **How** did they make those achievements?  
It's OK to develop different hobbies, but it's important to have a **STRENGTH**!
## Script
#### 1. Freedom of Thinking and Opportunity
For the first time in my life, I press a pause button to seriously think about what I truly want to do, what I truly want to be capable of doing and what I want to achieve.  
For the first time, I start consciously investing time and efforts in exploring and learning beyond what I know based on my interests instead of what I am told, required or supposed to learn.  
My interest have guided me to learn and improve my skills in programming and note-taking, and I'm also investing my time in learning techniques in graphic design, visual art, media editing and even drawing comics.  
I enjoy the freedom of having time to explore all these things that I think matters to me. 
#### 2. What's the cost?
But freedom from work comes with cost.  
The cost basically includes unpaid time and efforts, rent and food.  
So I tried my best to make sure that I can support myself and my decision of freeing myself from work will not turn me into a burden for anyone who cares about me.  
Because just being free from work doesn't mean that we are free from our social responsibilities and expectations.  
We still don't want to miss out the best time to get married, have children and get rich and we still don't want to disappoint our loved ones.  
We are still responsible for our time, decisions, choices and efforts. And with longer time and more efforts spent, the expectations grow. No one can afford to keep exploring forever for nothing.  
We'll still have to work hard to earn inward and outward recognition even though it doesn't have to be our salary in the short term.  
Whether we like it or not, our mind will constantly calculate the cost and gains for us.  
It can be a great passion killer sometimes, but we can use it as a reminder to use our time well. 
#### 3. How do we know our time is used smartly?
A common scenario is that when we have tried something for a relatively long time and still not get any expected outcome, there will be a inner voice starting to question ourselves.  
It can be used as an opportunity to refine our goal and improve the efficiency of our current approach. It's hard to get it right all at one go. There's always room for improvements.  
It's important to analyze why we haven't achieved our goal within the time we set for ourselves previously.  
We can ask ourselves:  
Is it because the goal isn't specific or realistic enough for the time given? ~~If so, how to make it accomplishable?~~  
Is it simply because the time is not enough to accomplish the goal? If so, how much extra time do we need? Why?  
We have to take serious concern about those questions. If not, we won't be able to truly optimize our time, and we may end up scrubbing the surface of everything but not being able to make value out of any of them.  
In that case, our unpaid journey will never ends. Unless you are strong enough to accept that you can be unpaid forever, make sure use your time well. 
#### 4. Aim for The Best, not The Worst Result
Throughout the journey of self-exploration, there'll always be a tendency to think about the worst result, because it's an effective way to fight back fear. Obviously, if the worst result is acceptable, then we'll have nothing to fear about.  
So you may constantly say to yourself:  
"I'm ready for the worst result. It is nothing more than the fact that my exploration or learning leads to nowhere in the end and I have to quit. Even when that happens, if I truly have spent time on exploring things I'm interested in, I will have nothing to regret about."  
But we wouldn't really want the worst result happen. We want to succeed in what we choose to do and do it as best as we can.  
Aiming for the best result is our only choice to make our journey meaningful and spectacular, to eventually make our life better!
#### 5. The Future
In a forseeable future, there will be more problems solved by AI and more work done by robots, but there's no need to feel sorry about those human unfriendly work that are meant to be resolved by AI or robots.  
AI is a collective human wisdom to take our productivity and efficiency to the next level.  It leaves room for us human to do better and more interesting things. It offers to us a variety of smart tool choices to extend our capabilities, to make our life better and easier.  
There will always be greater opportunities, as long as we hold on to our human-born traits and competence and don't take them for granted: humor, love, passion, courage, creativity, imagination, compassion, grit, tenacity, persistence, sense of beauty, critical thinking, team spirit, to name a few...  
They are the underlying power that makes our life meaningful and worth living.
#### 6. Follow Inner Voice
I am also working consciously to develop traits and competence that makes me a better person, humor, health, love, passion, courage, confidence, creativity, imagination, compassion, appreciation, grit, tenacity, persistence, sense of beauty, critical thinking...  
Whenever we decide to give ourselves more time to explore or learn, we'll have to justify the cost and reassure our brain that it'll be all worth it, otherwise we'll constantly be bothered by our self-doubt.  
not be rewarded by any bonus or salary but by sheer self-satisfaction. Only we get to decide whether it's worth it or not.  
Once our full time self-exploration begins, our time and efforts will be fully used for our own growth instead of any outward requirements or responsibilities. What we get in return in this journey will not be salary any more but a sheer self-satisfaction only we get to decide whether it's worth it or not.  
Many problems are supposed to be solved by AI, and lots of work are meant to be done by robots, because they are human unfriendly. AI leaves room for us to do better and more interesting things. It brings us many smart tools we can use to make our life better and easier.  
We should always work hard to develop traits and competence that make us different and unique, humor, health, love, passion, courage, confidence, creativity, imagination, compassion, appreciation, grit, tenacity, persistence, sense of beauty, critical thinking, team spirit...  
And it should never be used as a pain-killer or excuse for laziness.  
Think more about the best result. That is our ultimate goal and that's what makes our journey meaningful and spectacular.  
Succeeding in what we choose to do and doing it as best as we can is our only choice to make our life better!  
Making right decisions and sticking with them are not easy tasks.  
We may refer to the job market and look up to some living examples, but only when we turn those outward influence into our inner belief, can we be motivated to take some real actions.  
Time and time again, our inner belief will be tested either by more outward influence or by our self-doubt. But each test can be a chance for us to make adjustments and build stronger self-belief. Only the strongest self-belief will sustain us to fight against all odds into achieving our goal.  
When your self-doubt arrives, all you need to do is to simply ask yourself "Would you rather go back to your old 'comfort' zone or keep fighting a new way through for a better life?"  
Deep in your mind, I know I don't want to quit and I want to find my interest and be good at what I'm interested in and bring some true value to the world.  
So another question I often ask myself is "Am I making progress towards improving the skills I want to improve?" If the answer is yes, I would rather take self-doubt as a chance to **refine** my goal and improve the efficiency of my current approach.  
Leaving those work to AI, we will be able to do better and more interesting things ourselves, and develop traits and competence that are unique to human, humor, health, love, passion, courage, confidence, creativity, imagination, compassion, appreciation, grit, tenacity, persistence, sense of beauty, critical thinking...  
that I'm currently exploring like programming, graphic design, visual art, media editing can be replaced by AI technology some day, but I think it's still worth the effort to explore so that we can leave entry-level work for AI and do better and more interesting work ourselves. That way, we will be more able to use AI as a tool to make our life better.  
Ever since June 9, 2022, I've been free from work for 10 months. My initial plan was to find a job as a front-end engineer within 4 to 6 months.  
But as I stated previously, I've explored different skills in different fields. I want to make sure I've tried learning all the skills I'm interested in and that might be useful and meaningful in my life.  
It's still rather challenging for me to justify the cost, despite of everything I've gained though the process.  
Clearly there's a time limit. With longer time and more efforts spent, the expectations grow as well. Most people can't afford to keep exploring forever for nothing.  
What I can suggest is that before making any serious decisions, weigh the possible cost and evaluate the amount of efforts you can invest in.  
For the first time, I realize how incapable I am of making any impact in any field I can think of.  
Don't think that it's OK even if... It's not OK at all! You don't want your life to be like that at all.  
For me, my interests have guided me to improve my skills in programming and note-taking in the past 10 months, and I've also learned something about graphic design, visual art, media editing and even drawing comics.  
It may not be a wise choice to scatter my energy in so many different fields, since it only makes it more difficult for me to be employed in a target field. I know better than ever how ambitious I am and how shallow my understanding is in all those fields.  
But all I want to do is to find an interesting combination where I can create unique value continuously and consistently in the long run which benefit myself and people likewise. I want to make sure I've tried learning all the skills I'm interested in and that might be useful and meaningful in my life.  

I want to find an interesting combination where I can create unique value continuously and consistently in the long run which benefit myself and people likewise.  
It's a really complex process full of nuances that could be right or wrong given different context. And we have to constantly make decisions about where to go and what's best for ourselves and valued by the world.  
A common scenario is that when you have tried something for a relatively long period of time, you find it requires even longer time and more efforts. That's when self-doubt starts weighing in and you start to feel that the prospect of achieving the goal doesn't seem as appealing compared with the cost.  
"How can you be so sure about the future prospect when it's obviously changeable and depends on various conditions? How can you be so sure that the cost of going for your new adventure is going to be greater than the cost of staying in your comfort zone?"  
If the prospect of achieving the old goal doesn't appeal to you, what prospects do you expect? How are you going to achieve it? What choices are available to you?  
~~Don't be too petty about time. It's OK to spend time doing nothing. Remember your end goal is to simply relax and enjoy life.~~  
10 months may sound like a long period of time, but it's not long enough for us to make an impact in any of those fields. To make an impact or create value, we need to be focused, and dive into a certain field.  
I'm grateful that I am able to make that choice.  
This is what my dream life looks like-  
10 months is long enough for me to doubt myself dozens of times. It's long enough for me to wonder "Am I simply taking learning as an excuse for not working and taking responsibilities?"  
It's a deliberate choice, though I'd never expected it would take me so long to be good at something both I'm interested in and valued by the market.  
It's hard to find out the combination among what we are good at, what we're interested in, and what the society need.  
In most cases, only when we've tried and experienced something by ourselves for a long enough time, can we be certain whether we want it to continue being part of our life or not. That's what self-exploration costs.

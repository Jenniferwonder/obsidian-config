- Single codebase but risky for highly scalable platforms
#### 2. Microservices
- Isolation
- Scalability
- Flexibility
- Simplified development
##### 2.1. Disadvantage
- need for secure algorithm
- challenge of breaking the architecture into smaller features
#### 3. Serverless 
Use servers to run a web app, which are not hosted by the company
- Don't care about the server
- pay for used server space only
- tech support
#### 4. Best Practices
1. Find a solution that covers most of your goals
2. Choose the simplest option with minimalistic architecture
3. Keep your architecture lightweight
4. Your architecture should be able to identify and repair issues on its own
5. Automate process
6. Pay attention to Data Storing
### Client-side development approaches
#### 1. SPA
#### 2. MPA
- Complex backend development
- Lower performance speed
- Complicated debugging
#### 3. [[Service Worker-PWA]]
#### 4. JAM-Stack

#### 1. Introduction
Hey guys! In this video, I wanna **share with** you **two effective and practical ways** to improve our spoken English.  
They are shadowing and retelling.  
With shadowing and retelling, **even though** we are not living in a foreign country where everybody speaks English, we can still learn **authentic way of English speaking**.  
I'm gonna show you how they actually work.  
This is a speech deliverd by Steve Jobs at Stanford University, which is very **instructive**.  
How can we **make the best use of it** to do shadowing and retelling?  
#### 2. Shadowing
First, let's see how shadowing works.  
**All we need to do is** to hit the 'play' button, then pause at some point and repeat the exact same words the speaker just said.  
Let's have a try!  
"It's an honor to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world."  
**Yes, just like that.** 
If you **get stuck** or forget some words in the speech, **it's OK**. Just replay the part <u>you're not sure about</u> **until** you can repeat it smoothly. 
**Make sure** you use the **exact same** words, speed, tempo, intonation, gestures **and** even facial expressions of the speaker, **'cause** that will help our brain **get the essence of** all the tricks we need to know about **the** correct pronunciation. 
#### 3. Retelling
Now let's see how retelling works.  
**The golden trick of retelling** is to pretend that you are retelling the part of information you heard to **a real person**. And **if necessary**, **take some notes** while you are listening.  
Let's have a try.  
"..."  
So Steve Jobs just told us a truth about himself which is he never graduated from a college. Giving the speech was the closest he had ever been to a college graduation. In this speech, he wants to tell us three stories from his life. "That's it. No big deal." That's what he said  
**That is a way of retelling.** 
**Apparently,** it's more challenging, **'cause** we need to **use our own words** to reconstruct the information, **but** it **gives us a chance to** **use and apply** what we learned immediately.  
**For example,** I **notice and apply** some useful phrases, expressions and sentence structures Steve uses in his speech, like the one "Truth be told" which we normally would say "To tell you a truth", "Honestly speaking", "To be honest", but it's retelling, so we can't use any of them, so I retell by saying "He told us a truth about himself."  
**There're also** **phrases** like "graduate from a college", "stories from my life", and the **closing expressions** like "No big deal. That's it.", and also the **sentence structure** like "This is the closest I've ever been to".  
Through retelling, we're able to **use** all of those nice phrases, expressions and sentence structures and **truly remember** them. Isn't it great?
#### 4. Conclusion
So **to wrap it up**, that is how we can do shadowing and retelling to improve our spoken English in an effective way.

#### 5. Retelling-Plus 
So are there any tricks we can use when doing retelling? The answer is yes.  
One is that we need use the correct person's perspective when doing retelling, but in most cases, we just need to change the first person's perspective to the third person's perspective. For example, if the speaker said "I never graduated from a college", when retelling, we can simply say 'he never graduated from a college'.  
Second, make sure to use the correct tense. This is a tricky part, which takes more practice. But usually, we just need to change the present tense to the past tense. For example, if the speaker said "This is the closest I have ever gotten to a college graduation", you can retell by saying "That was the closest he had ever gotten to a college graduation."  
If you want to retell a longer part of story and keep as many details as possible, you should take notes. More often than not, you need to replay the part of story until you feel ready to retell. There are some note taking strategies you can use, but it's out of the scope of this video, so maybe I'll show you in another video.  
Anyway, the golden trick of retelling is to pretend that you are retelling the part of information you heard to a real person. That way, our brain will figure out most of the things by itself. 
### 1st Complete Script
#### 1. Introduction
Hey guys! In this video, ~~I'm gonna.~~ I wanna share with you **two ways** I find truly effective and practical to improve our spoken English. They are shadowing and retelling.  
With shadowing and retelling, even though we don't have the chance to live in a foreign country to learn English from or don't have a language partner to practice English with, we can still improve our spoken English.  
Here's a speech deliverd by Steve Jobs at Stanford University. It's classic and instructive. How can we make the best use of this speech to do shadowing, retelling and finally improve our English?  
#### 2. Shadowing
First, let's see how shadowing works. Shadowing means repeating the exact same words the speaker just said. By doing that, we can improve our pronunciation, because shadowing makes it easier for us to compare our pronunciation with the speaker's pronunciation so that we can make necessary adjustment to our pronunciation to make it sounds more natural and native.  
So all we need to do is to hit the 'play' button, then pause at some point and repeat the part we hear, just like this ...  
"It's an honor to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world."  
Wow, I think I got it right. So try to use the exact same words, speed, tempo, intonation, gesture **and** even facial expression of the speaker, because that will help our brain get the essence of all the tricks we need to know about pronunciation. But if you get stuck or forget some words ~~when doing shadowing~~ in this process, it's OK. Just replay the part you're not sure about until you can repeat **without any words missing**. Remember the whole purpose is to let our brain get used to the correct way of speaking, right?  
#### 3. Retelling
So how does retelling work? Let's continue the speech, alright? ~~And I'm gonna show you how it works.~~  
"..."  
So Steve Jobs just told us a truth about himself which is he never graduated from a college. Giving the speech was the closest he had ever been to a college graduation. In this speech, he wants to tell us three stories from his life. "No big deal. That's it." That's what he said.  
That's a way of retelling- to retell a part of speech or story in our own words. Apparently, it's more challenging, because you need to reconstruct the speech in  your own words, **but** it gives us a chance to apply what we learned immediately, which is helpful in building our ability to use more precise words and better expressions in our own speaking.  
Here are some tricks I find helpful in retelling.  
One is that you can simply change the first person's perspective to the third person's perspective. For example, if the speaker said "I never graduated from a college", when retelling, we can say 'he never graduated from a college'.  
Second, make sure to use the correct tense. For example, if the speaker said "This is the closest I have ever gotten to a college graduation", you can retell by saying "That was the closest he had ever gotten to a college graduation." Usually, we just need to change the present tense to the past tense.  
You can just imagine that you are actually retelling something you heard to a real person.  
#### 4. Conclusion
So **to wrap it up**, if you wanna improve your spoken English, try shadowing and retelling. You will find them truly helpful **along the way**.

### 1st Draft
~~**Speaking of** spoken English, <u>I'm pretty sure many of you understand how important</u> it is, especially if you are an English major, because **truth be told**, spoken English has become the most crucial and direct aspect for people to judge from how good our English is.  
But we all find it hard to improve.  
We face the same problem like we don't have any proper **language partner** to practice English with or it's hard to find one. We live in an **environment** where everybody speaks Chinese and it feels hard to set up a so-called language environment for us to improve English.  
So are there any better and more pratical ways? Yes, there are. We can do **shadowing and retelling**.~~  
~~But with shadowing and retelling, we can effectively improve spoken English by ourselves.~~  
**Shadowing** means repeat the part of speech we just heard as precisely as possible; while **retelling** means retell either the part of speech or the whole speech we just heard in our own words, retaining as much authentic information as possible.  
**Shadowing** is of great help in improving our pronunciation and **retelling** is specially helpful with our application of the ~~advanced or native~~ expressions and vocabulary we just heard. Let's see how they actually work.  
~~I know many of you may have heard about these two ways before, but let me show you how I use them to practice and improve spoken English, so that you know how they actually work.~~  
You get the point.  
We live in an environment where everybody speaks Chinese.  
English is always this plus nice-to-have skill in our resume. But when we do need it, we always find that we are not good enough. We can not use it comfortably and fluently to express our thinking, or use it interact and communicate with people. Why?  
When can we end this vicious circle where everybody is pushed to invest a huge amount of time learning English but still being unable to speak English properly or not even taking any chance to actually use it?  
Pretty self-explanatory.
- Speak Englsih as often as possible.  
	- Be confident.
	- Don't be a perfectionist. 
- Record an audio or video of yourself speaking English.

## Vue-Based

  - Hybrid rendering, Nitro server engine

## Svelte-Based

- Sveltekit (Svelte)
  - SSR, SSG, Routing...
  - Hydrating the page: (骨架屏？)
    - Loads components **on server** first and send it to the client as HTMl, and render the components on the page again **in the browser** to make it interactive
  - You can control what you want to render on the server as well as the client
  - User faced page - Server rendered vs Admin panel - SPA, **Why**?

## C#/WASM-Based

- Blazor (C#, WASM/ Web Assembly)
  - Hot reload, lazy loading, virtualization

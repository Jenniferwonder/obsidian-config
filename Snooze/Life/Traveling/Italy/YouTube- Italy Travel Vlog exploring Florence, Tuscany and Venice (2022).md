## Highlights
Our first stop in Italy is... 
We **took a flight** from Madrid to Milan and then hoped on a **train** to Venice. It was actually much more affordable to fly into Milan versus flying into Venice directly.

So we just took a train from Milan which was fairly easy to navigate.

We booked a business class for the train which in my option were worth it. I think it was only an additional 10 or 15 Euro but **it was so spacious and made the trip so much comfortable**. It went by so fast.
We arrived **in the late afternoon**, and we just felt so tired, so we went out for an early dinner. And this was probably some of the best food I had actually when we were in Venice, surprisingly the first night.
I bought ... so good.

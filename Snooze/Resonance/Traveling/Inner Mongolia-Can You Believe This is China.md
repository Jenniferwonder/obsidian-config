## Highlights
- It's **golden week** here in China and we decided to **ditch the city and head for some countryside**, so this is where is me in Inner Mongolia[^1]
- We're staying at the summer **camp** of a semi-normadic Mongolian family
	- They rent out in the summer months from June to October
	- Enjoy authentic experience
	- Book through **Airbnb** 
	- It's very in size but they're beautifully constructed with **wooden poles** and other traditional materials, each one is equipped with a **log burning stove** to give you **nice and toasty** throughout the night
- With **panoramic views** over the wind fat rat fun and **not a soul in sight**, this is an ideal place to come for a couple of days.
- If you're an active type, you'll be sure of things to do
	- You can walk in all directions, seeing lots of wildlife along the way
	- Stumble across the **sand dunes** to go **sand sledging**
	- Sharpen up your **archery skills**, or
	- **Ride a hook**
- At the center of the camp, it's a large kamila yet, 
	- We can enjoy some hearty Mongolian food, or 
	- Kick back with a beer in front of the fire after a long day of hiking
	- The meals **had excellent value** and it was great to try some traditional dishes
- Evenings are best spent 
	- staring up at the Milky way or 
	- practicing your Mongolian dancing skills
- I came here in early October and it's already really cold in the evenings, so 
	- I recommend bringing a jumper or three
- This is my first time in inner Mongolia, 
	- the warm culture and 
	- stunning landscape I discovered have left me wanting to come back already
- As it's just a seven hour drive from Beijing, it's safe to say I will.

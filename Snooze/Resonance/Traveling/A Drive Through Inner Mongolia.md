## Highlights
### Intro
- Inner Mongolia- A region know for its vast grasslands, desserts and mountains. It's home to many ethnic minorities and has a rich culture. In the next five days, I'm going to drive through the area and see **what it's like to visit**- Inner Mongolia.
- And 5 hours after leaving Shanghai, I'm in **Ordos** (Inner Mongolia Ordos Airport), and I have got myself a car.
### Dessert
- Let's go to the dessert and see some camels ^pg7lxz
	- Wow. Now we're in the **dessert** (Kubuqi Dessert in Inner Mongolia). It was already getting late, but I was really excited to have a walk around the **sand dunes** and we **settled in** the first night in the dessert.
	- I woke up early in the morning and I was a bit concerned as to **weather** would be a bit boring in the dessert but that was really not the case.
	- I'm going to go **sandboarding**
	- **green lake** over the sand dunes
		- The drive was a bit crazy.
		- Absolute madness
	- Must do for the dessert
		- **Riding a camel**

### Volcanos

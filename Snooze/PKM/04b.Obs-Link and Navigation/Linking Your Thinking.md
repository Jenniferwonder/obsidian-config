## ‍**I had no room for my own thoughts!**

I started Evernote in 2008. It was great at first. I “clipped” a lot of web articles.

I also used Evernote to build an international fitness boxing business and to produce two indie feature films. And personally, I used my digital notes to reflect, to write, and to think.

It worked, for a while. But secretly, a hidden cancer was growing in my notes. I still remember the pain of trying to put together a business proposal for opening a boxing gym in NYC—and slamming the keyboard because **I was wasting so much time searching for lost notes.**

**‍**

I used to jump into my notes to get my thoughts in order, but after 5 years, opening Evernote was no longer fun. It was stressful. It caused my mind to feel scattered. **Just the thought of opening my notes created surprising amounts of anxiety.

‍

**The problem was that my notes were becoming less of *my* notes. I was capturing so much NOISE that I was drowning out the SIGNAL. Since I was filling up my notes with other people's thoughts, **I had no room for my own thoughts!

‍

**The happiness I used to feel using my digital notes was experiencing “death by a thousand cuts.” When I couldn't find my most valuable thoughts, **I started to feel like I was losing a part of myself.

‍

**My joy evaporated.

‍**I knew there had to be a better way...**

## ‍**There is a better way**

When I decided to leave Evernote, I realized that **my notes were trapped** in Evernote's proprietary format. Even when I did figure out a way to export my notes to plain text, it BROKE. EVERY. LINK. If you haven’t experienced the pain of transferring your notes, it can sabotage your work sessions years into the future.

But by the end of 2015, **I finally had full ownership of my notes again**. I made my notes plain text. Because of that move, I was using linked notes half a decade before they burst onto the scene. There were no systems to follow.

So **I spent the next several years stress-testing and iterating on the universal frameworks hidden in linked notes.** I used it in the real world for several extremely diverse efforts in my life (described more below).

**My joy returned. And so did my successes.**

I discovered what made our knowledge fragile, what made it robust, and what made it come alive!

**Being able to finally use technology to connect our ideas is a revolution**. Now we can use external tools to support our thinking efforts in the same way our brain naturally works!

That's why I'm calling all writers, thinkers, life-long-learners, content creators, entrepreneurs and knowledge workers...

If you want to do your best thinking, more often, **there is a better way.**

It starts with this:

• Less collecting. More connecting.  
• Less highlights. More insights.

***Your best thinking is when you are fully engaged in the stuff in front of you, connecting it to other stuff—and finding your unique perspective amongst it all.*** Want to get there reliably? Consistently?

The knowledge management principles we teach and train in the LYT Workshop will give you the insights, guidance, and support to unlock and empower your best thinking.

And, **you will leave the workshop with your own, future-proof PKM system** —a supercharged "**ideaverse**" to support and power all of your thinking efforts.

### Meet the creator of Linking Your Thinking
Hi, I'm Nick Milo.
I’ve spent the last 15 years using digital notes to create and grow a fitness boxing into an international company, produce two independent feature films, become a TV and film editor, and—perhaps most importantly—to calm my thoughts and make better sense of the world around me.

![image of nick milo](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f7f16adf0e1d240ab23c493/5f8684abca3bcc61683d12b8_Nick_LYT_Picture2.png)

Hi, I'm Nick Milo.

I’ve spent the last 15 years using digital notes to create and grow a fitness boxing into an international company, produce two independent feature films, become a TV and film editor, and—perhaps most importantly—to calm my thoughts and make better sense of the world around me.

#### I’ve tested and stretched the limits of Personal Knowledge Management in the “real world”:

-   from the fitness industry 🏃‍♂️  to the film industry 🎬
-   from the football field 🏈   to civil engineering 🏗
-   from strength training 🏋️‍♂️  to the boxing ring 🥊
-   from public speaking 🎤  to content creation 🎨

What I’ve learned is this: ***being effective at managing knowledge is a superpower—and linking your thinking supercharges it.***

The frameworks I teach unlock our ability to work with ideas in a way that is fast, flexible, and future-proof. I have taught the principles of linked notes to thousands of people with great results. These principles are flexible enough for you to shape them to your unique use cases and personal needs.

## Do you want to...

Do you want to ***build your custom, future-proof ideaverse***  
that will support & power your thinking efforts for the rest of your life?

### **Do you want to work better in your research?**

Do you need to process large amounts of information and synthesize it into something clear and cohesive?

### **Do you want to make better sense of the world?**

Do you have many interests and want a system that helps you make connections & see the patterns between ideas?

### **Do you want to create consistently?**

Do you love reading, writing, teaching, and sharing? Do you want to consistently unlock your unique perspective?

### **Do you want to write big and often complex things?**

Do you need support & power for writing your: novels, screenplays, books, D&D campaigns, or dissertations?

### **Do you want to get your thoughts in order?**

Do you want to journal, reflect, and live your days with more intention, calm, and expanded creativity?

### **Do you want to be productive with your efforts?**

Do you want to be efficient and focused with your projects and efforts in order to manage them effectively?

If any of one of these resonate with you, then you can immensely benefit  
from attending the LYT Workshop. It is the best way to reliably  
‍***build your custom, future-proof ideaverse*** that will  
support & power your thinking efforts for the rest of your life.

Are you always feeling like you're playing catchup in your work?

The LYT Workshop helps you build a space where you can retrieve anything quickly and effortlessly whether you have 10 notes or 10,000 notes.

Your notes should support your efforts, not be the source of your stress.

The LYT Workshop helps you develop a system that will grow and evolve as you do over time in a sustainable healthy way.

Notes don't end at the capture of an idea. Design a space that can help you connect and develop your thoughts.

The LYT Workshop helps you create a space that has room not just to revisit your notes, but to truly engage and expand on them.

Your ideas aren't static, your notes shouldn't be either.

![](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f7f16adf0e1d240ab23c493/628b03f1e2396974ffb6969d_5e4f355211b3f03c75c2ad20_quotation.png)

The most important thing is that you \*shouldn't\* make a note on everything you encounter and the LYT Workshop will help you separate the signal from the noise.

By being intentional about what we choose to bring into your notes, it elevates the value of all of your notes as well as makes it easier to work in.

![](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f7f16adf0e1d240ab23c493/63286ec70aa71b69a1ea4a94_LYT%20Workshop%20Super%20Session%202.024.png)

We've all had it happen. If we're unable to capture that fresh idea in the moment, it might be gone forever.

The LYT Workshop can help you make notes at the speed of thought.

![](https://global-uploads.webflow.com/5f7f16adf0e1d240ab23c493/63286ec70aa71b69a1ea4a94_LYT%20Workshop%20Super%20Session%202.024.png)

Being creative is more than just having outputs such as blog posts, books, or other public-facing content.

The LYT Workshop can help you build a space to explore creative solutions to problems or simply developing a sustainable system where you can quickly retrieve anything as well as find and develop connections between notes.

You will get results

*The LYT system is fluid enough for me to think the way I am wired, and yet gives structure that my mind sometimes craves.*

*I didn't think it was possible to do that.*

***It’s transformed my perception of what a system can be like and I am blown by the possibilities!***

The workshop is forcing me to **embrace a "first principles" approach** to idea emergence!

The workshop prompts surprised me. The 7C's for note-making were super useful to start "wrestling with ideas". **The enthusiasm and openness of the participants was amazing.**

I was initially quite intimidated, however, I soon embraced what Nick said about “leaning in”, now, **I am loving it and am already applying the LYT frameworks in my work.**

The Linking your thinking workshop will change the way you relate to knowledge and your own ideas.  
‍**It will change the way you think for the better.**

This workshop has helped me actually **transition to being a note-maker through a well-paced and very thoughtful curriculum** that has, to borrow one of Nick's phrases, helped me "do the reps."

I feel very confident about the prospects of leveraging a PKM system to transmute ideas in my head to real-world solutions. **Really feels like learning a superpower!**

### What makes LYT so different?

### Is this you?

People that have tried out other systems come to us, and they say...*"I was able to organize* ***information*** *but it didn't help me with* ***knowledge****."  
‍*Is this you?  
If you’re trying to do PKM but you feel stuck—or something feels “off”—it may be because ***your system is encouraging you to focus on the wrong things.***So what are the right things?

#### Six focal points in Linking Your Thinking 
are what will finally get you ***actually*** working with your Knowledge!

1. **Connecting** more than **collecting**.

Collecting a new idea does not equal KNOWING a new idea, or being able to effectively work with it—or even explain it to others. If you take anything away from these words, remember this:

***We don’t need more knowledge every second. Instead, we need to get better at developing the knowledge we already have.*** ^pnpsft

2. **Insights** more than **highlights**.

Put down the highlighter and slowly step away! Once you do, something amazing happens. You open a space to think—to connect—and to generate your own insights.

Multi-step highlighting techniques encourage the habit of “collecting without processing”. In practice, this means you’ll save many articles, and process few. This creates a PKM system where 99% of the stuff in there are ***someone else’s thoughts, not yours.***

***It disconnects you from your own thinking and creates a sterile thinking environment devoid of joy.***

  
This is the “Fall of the Note-Taker”: Too much note-taking kneecaps your best thinking and harms the long-term health of your PKM system.

The future will favor the Note-Maker. Note-making is where you are creating the most personal meaning and value.

3\. **Your perspective** more than **theirs**.

You can’t get to yours, if you’re always just highlighting theirs! The trouble with chronic note-takers is that they never get the part where they’re doing their best thinking.

Where do you think your unique perspective comes out? From bolding and highlighting the words of other people, or from writing your own thoughts and making the insights yourself? We need you to be your best self.

***We need you to share your unique perspective with the rest of us.***

4. **Links** more than **folders**.

If you are merely clipping articles and filing resources, folders are fine. But in truth, ***that’s less “Knowledge” Management and more “Information Resource” Management.  
***  
And maybe that’s what you want.

But if you care about knowledge, ideas, and making leaps of insights; then you simply must learn how to link ideas in a powerful and future-proof way.

Once you start linking ideas together, you cross the threshold, and there’s no going back. Your neurons are firing like they should and you are spending more time doing your best thinking. It feels good, doesn’t it?

Looking back, you laugh at how silly it was to try to do PKM without linking. Oh, Life!

5. **Ideas** more than **tasks**.

If you want to get things done, learn GTD. If you want to build a rich universe of ideas that you develop throughout your life, learn LYT.

If you want a course on project management, take one of the million courses on that. But if you want to improve how you actually work with ideas (not just sort them into folders), then learn LYT.

6\. **PKM** more than **Productivity**.

Hey, I get it. We have to get things done. But look around. You’ll find everyone kneeling at the alter of “tasks”, “projects”, “tracking”, and “getting things done”.

Somehow, we gave up the inherent joy of thinking, as its own reward. We stripped away the soul of inquiry and replaced it with soulless efficiency. Can you even remember a time when you felt calm and joy jumping into your notes? Because...

***Ironically, it's when you stop exploiting and start exploring, that you generate some of your best ideas and insights!***You may not know this, but you have a choice. You don’t have to serve your task manager. Take the power back. Choose to be led by the carrot of curiosity over stick of a task list.

### What will you leave the workshop saying?

Here are the top 6 most common results from our students

"I am **creating** more than ever."

"I am **finding** my notes reliably."

"I am **conquering** overwhelm."

"I am **giving** more value to others."

"I am **generating** more insights."

"I rediscovered the joy of **thinking.**"

## Frequently asked questions

Everything you need to know about the Linking Your Thinking Workshop. Can’t find the answer you’re looking for? Please [chat to our support team](mailto:hello@linkingyourthinking.com).

**What is your refund policy?**

You can make a full refund request at hello@linkingyourthinking.com before the end of the first week of the workshop. No withdrawals or refunds are possible after the first 7 days of the workshop.

**When does the course start and finish?**

Workshop 12's onboarding will start on September 25, 2023. It will end on October 27, 2023.

**Do you offer payment plans?**

**What if I can't attend live?**

Can't make it live? No worries, we will record the whole event and everyone who buys a seat will have access to the recording forever.

**How long will I have access to the program?**

You will have lifetime access to the program. Plus, as we update the curriculum and continue to provide resources for the workshop, you will continue to have access to those updates.

**I use Notion, Roam, or Logseq. Will this work for me?**

Yes! Because the principles are based on linking ideas.

We had a few people use Roam in the previous workshop. They found the MOCs in particular to be very empowering.

**Do I have to use Obsidian?**

No. You'll just want to use something that allows you to link notes quickly.

So that would be something like Obsidian or Roam or Remnote or Athens or anything that allows for link-based notes can work.

**I'm new. What type of technical help can I expect?**

That said, please have a basic understanding of how to make links and how to make tags. ***This is not a course on teaching you Obsidian!***

Now as far as the workshop, all the examples are shown in Obsidian, and the fancy advanced features are not needed. I'll talk about some cool hotkeys from time to time, but the focus is squarely on how we can work with link-based notes. ***These are timeless fundamentally no matter the software.***  
While this workshop isn't course on how to use a specific piece of software, you're surrounding yourself with people you can help, and surprisingly, like to help a lot!

**Can’t I just learn all of this for free online or in Youtube?**

I do my best to provide MASSIVE amounts of free value on Youtube. But even that content can't compare to the value you get in the workshop.

The workshop is hands-on, focused-work, with people solving the same problems that you're trying to solve...that's how you accelerate your growth! Instead of walking down the wrong path for several years (like I did in Evernote by over-collecting), you can quickly revise and iterate your knowledge management system in "real-time" so you not only build a system that remains useable and scales with your ever-changing needs—but you also ensure that your digital notes remain a source of joy.

**What amount of time will I need to commit to the course?**

It depends. The minimal time you should be able to commit to make this thing worthwhile is probably around 1-2 hours per week.

For the expected experience, try to budget around 6-8 hours per week—that includes the live sessions of course.

For the best experience, just attend the live sessions (or watch the recordings as soon as they are available), go through the lessons, make comments, read what others have shared, and be an active part of this amazing gathering of inspiring thinkers!

**I'd love to join, but I'm from a developing country and the cost is too high for me. Are there scholarships?**

"Like a string of beads, it is our unique differences and intricacies that make us so appealing and attractive." — Lindsey Lunsford, M.E.M., Second Edition DEI Fellow

It would break my heart if the reason you can't attend is because of where you were born. That's not just. It's important to me—and crucial for all of our thinking—that we have a diverse mixture of perspectives. This means not turning a blind eye to how the price point can immediately exclude valuable voices.

That said, you can apply for our scholarship program [right here.](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/lyt-workshop-11-scholarship)

## Learning is better together

### Active, not passive

The workshop is designed get you to **lean forward** and engage—in multiple ways—with the material. The result: **deep and lasting personal gains.**

### Faster alone at first, further together forever

**You are surrounded by curious—often brilliant—thinkers**. Even if they are doctor and you are a dungeon master, their ideas will create new associations in your mind. From that, you may just solve your own unique use case!

### Comfortably uncomfortable

In a safe environment, you will get your thinking muscles burning. You will be encouraged to share. And **the insights you gain from seeing your system through the eyes of your peers can be transformational.**

If you are looking for a "language" to exchange ideas between your most inner-self and the external world, this workshop is for you.

This was a game changer for me. My PKM is a direct reflection of me and not some half-modelled, half-copied system of someone else.

Moving from note-taker to note-maker is one of the most powerful ways you can improve the quality of your own thinking.

### UNLOCK THE WAY YOUR IDEAS EVOLVE.

The ENCODE framework gives you the keys to reliably unstick your thinking so you can generate more meaningful insights and spend more time doing your best work.

We encounter ideas

<< and >>

We express ideas

We can't avoid it. But we can get better at it.  
The ENCODE Framework describes how  
your knowledge evolves.

-   **E**ncounter new ideas
-   **N**ote the ideas that interest you
-   **C**onnect ideas to things you know
-   **O**rganize ideas so you can find them
-   **D**evelop ideas to generate new insights
-   **E**xpress your ideas to others

Creative expression is NOT a linear process. ENCODE is our diagnostic tool to  
decode where you are locked, so every part of you can be playing in sync.

### LYT Workshop 9

## Why the workshop works

### *Linking Your Thinking created and follows the  
six principles of Lean Forward Learning™*

Online learning is different. It's the wild west out there.

My deep goal is to inspire other teachers in online education to incorporate the paradigm of *Lean Forward Learning* into their own educational products and services.

The Lean Forward paradigm is an extension of the "Learn by doing" theory of education set forth by *John Dewey* in the early 1900's. However, ***the Lean Forward paradigm is different because it outlines principles specifically for online education.***

I believe online workshop designed like Linking Your Thinking are just the beginning of a deeper level of digital learning. Sitting back and passively watching instructional videos is easy, but the results are far less powerful. Instead, the LYT formula forces you to grab the controls and pilot the ship.

Designing the right educational experience with these principles in mind provides students with an effective and profound learning experience.

Here are the Six Principles of Lean Forward Learning™.

-   **Curated yet Non-linear**: There is a sense of freedom, and yet, a sense of structure. As a student, you have some agency to “Choose Your Own Adventure”.
-   **Hands-on Repetitions**: The very nature of the workshop builds in inescapable hands-on repetitions with the exact thing you are trying to learn. Just like a video game, if you don't take the controls and move forward, you don't make progress. In other words, it's designed to force "unavoidable engagement".
-   **Uncomfortable**: The very nature of the workshop means that the adventurer will be uncomfortable, challenged, and sometimes even frustrated. Those are "*deep reps*". That’s when the deepest, stickiest learning happens! And it's the getting stuck that leads to sticky learning.
-   **Immersive**: It feels like a special self-contained mini-world...a holistic learning system.
-   **Measurable**: There are ways to measure a student's progress.
-   **Multiple Avenues of Engagement**: Students don't just "read" and "watch". They DO. Plus they also do some combination of: commenting, interacting, and sharing. This ties back into getting reps: reading reps, watching reps, doing reps...reps commenting, interacting, and sharing.

The LYT Workshop did not design the six principles of Lean Forward Learning™ . No. The principles were *born from* the LYT Workshop!

The LYT Workshop is the model for an all-encompassing tsunami of a learning experience.

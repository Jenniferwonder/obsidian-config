### About Your Trainer

![](https://www.visual-thinking-workshop.com/images/Zsolt.png)

I'm Zsolt Viczi√°n, a seasoned engineer with over two decades of experience in problem-solving and cross-disciplinary knowledge. I bring a wealth of expertise to my work, having served in leadership roles at international companies for 20+ years and earned a Ph.D. from the Technical University of Budapest, as well as multiple Master's degrees in Electrical and Biomedical Engineering. As a lifelong learner and PMP-certified project manager, I'm always looking for new ways to expand my skills and knowledge.

I love developing tools and integrations to optimize my personal and professional workflows. With my experience building tools like Excalidraw and ExcaliBrain within Obsidian, that can link drawings, images, and text, I'm confident that I can help you unlock your brain's visual processing power and boost your creativity through the Visual Thinking Workshop.

I'm always experimenting with new workflows and implementing my ideas into software. My visual thinking workflows and toolset have been rigorously tested and refined over the past 30 years, making them powerful solutions for your workflow. By joining the Visual Thinking Workshop, you'll benefit from my hard-earned experience and jumpstart your own journey, saving you time and effort.

#### 1. Take This Chanllenge and See What Will Happen!

#### 2. Day 1: Aug 16 Remember You are Not Alone!

I DateStarted recording radio again.  
In recent three days, I DateStarted practice pronunciation again.  
I realize there are still many problems and imperfections in my pronunciation and way of speaking English. I would still make uncouscious mistake as I speak English.  
Unable to speak English as natural and fluent as a native is a problem bothers me a lot.  
I feel so difficult to acknowledge my competence in English as an English major.  
Luckily, I think I idenfied the reasons account for my incompetency in spoken and written English.

- Active and critical Reading
- Active and critical Speaking and Writing
- Muscle training is still inadequate

Therefore, I decided to:

- Get familiar with and get used to English thinking.
- Be brave and don't afraid to make mistakes.
- Share as much as I can.

Most importantly, I decide to launch this 30 minutes challenge, i.e. Speak English for 30 minutes and Write English for 30 minutes everyday.  
The best time to do it for now is **20:00- 21:10 with 10 minutes break. **This is a promise and commitment I made for myself and I will stick to it.

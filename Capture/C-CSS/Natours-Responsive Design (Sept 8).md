## What I have learned

Yesterday (Sept 8), I learned and applied SASS and CSS responsive design techniques in NATOUR projects which adopts the flexbox layout method.

## Aspects to improve

### Time Efficiency

It took about 4-5 dedicated hours to make everything responsive as expected. Clearly there are better ways to deliver the same results like using a cleaner clode with variables in “mixins” file and using more efficient layout method incorporating both Flexbox and Grid etc.

### Possible Solutions

And clearly there are much more to explore in some more advanced CSS Skills include:

- Media layout: bg-image/ bg-video
- Gradient color
- SVG, Image editing: clip-path; mask…
- Grid
- Animation effects: iframe, transition, transform…

### Risk

But the restraint is that my **time, energy and budget** are all limited.

### Resolution

I have to move on to solve other bigger issures before I can come back to dig deeper on the above topics, but I will keep my eyes open to the applications of the above skills and seek opportunities to implement as best as I can.

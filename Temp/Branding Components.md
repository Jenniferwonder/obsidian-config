# Branding Components

- ✨ Values
    1. Freedom - Avoid being shackled to a job you don’t enjoy
    2. Efficiency - If we can get the stuff we _have_ to do **done efficiently, we can spend more time and energy on the stuff we _want_ to do.
    3. Journey Before Destination - This is one of the ideals of the _Knights Radiant_ from Brandon Sanderson’s _The Stormlight Archive_ series. I fully embrace this. Similar to Miley Cyrus’ _“Ain’t about how fast I get there. Ain’t about what’s waiting on the other side. It’s the climb”._ I’ve referenced both these many times in videos.
    4. Diversification = If we can diversify our interests and our identity, we’re more antifragile. It’s more fun to be a jack of all trades than a master of one.
    5. Lifelong Learning = Learning stuff is really fun. Being on the steep bit of the learning curve is incredibly satisfying.
    6. Happiness is a Choice
    7. Relationships are the most important things in life

## Intro
- Hi! My name is Jennifer. I used to be an English teacher. But now I have spent months learning something I feel excited about - programming, specifically speaking, front-end engineering. 
## Body
#### 1. Why do I decide to make a career shift?
- I know how incredible this sounds like for an English teacher trying to learn something seemingly irrelevant to her major.
- But I've constantly asked myself "Is teaching students how to pass English examinations or doing translation the only thing I can do?" 
- Sure not.   
- English is more than that and life is more than English. 
- There are tons of interesting things worth to explore and I am still passionate about learning. Why not take a shot? 
#### 2. Why do I choose front-end engineering?
- I know recently with AI technologies like ChatGPT, and the increasingly competitive job market, there're sayings like "coding is dead", "front-end engineering is dead." 
- But what else isn't dead if we choose to be pessimistic like that? I take uncertainty as opportunities. 
- Front-end engineering is still a great start for beginners to experience the power of computer science and programming. 
- With front-end engineering technology, we can build fantastic UIs for almost all applications we are using today, whether it's a website, an app or a mini-program. 
#### 3. Power of English
- Proficiency in both Chinese and English will provide us extra opportunities to be a better learner, 
- and give us a previlege to learn from authentic resources and documents at ease, to have a different perspective of thinking. 
- But to be a qualified front-end engineer, it requires tons of skills and knowledge that you can never learn enough.  
- For sure, it is not an easy path. To be honest, it has taken longer time and more efforts than I expected. 
#### 4. Do I regret about choosing Front-end engineering?
- Not a bit. 
- Because despite the challenges, I've also learned so much and I do have grown my skills in a way that I'd never thought of. 
- There's still a long way to go but I know with the skills I'm learning, I will be able to build something cool with code. I will experience a different life. 
## Conclusion 
- So I'm happy about what I'm learning and hope to share more lessons and stories with you in this journey. 
- Thanks for your watching. See you next time. Take care!

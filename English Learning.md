## Now
I treat English as my **working language** whther in note-taking, daily reflection or video recording.
I think this is the only way I can improve and excel in English.
## The Only Goal
I wanna figure out-
How can I <u>improve my English speaking and writing</u> while learning <u>programing skills</u>?
## Why English and Programming?
I hope one day I can have my own channel sharing 
- help **programmers** learn and improve English
- help **English major** know how to learn programming in English
- my study vlog in English
- beautiful moments in life
- small tips 
- **my life/ things I care** in English.

Because English is my major. It's something I care about and I'm interested in. It's something I'm capable of doing. English has become a part of my life and I don't want to just lose it and let it rot.

## Reflection, Jan

#### 1. Biggest Achievements

- Build up [[My Goals in 2023]]
- Figure out the **priority** to be a front-end engineer- be good at [[Areas/Front-End/00-Roadmap/Front-End Tech Stack]]
- Figure out [[English Learning]] myths and the final way to truly be proficient in English, which is to **use and integrate** it in things you care.

#### 2. Why is it hard to stay focused?

Till [[2023-01-31]], I've spent-

- 3 days on [[JavaScript]] reflection
- 3 days on learning [[React]]
- 9 days on [[English Learning]] trying out ways to improve my spoken English while learning front-end technology
- 1 day on [[Figma]]
- 9 days spending [[2023 Spring Festival Holidays]] with my family
- 2 days on reflection
  - [[Video Editing]]
  - [[Monthly Reflection]]
- 1 day back on [[React]]  
  I can see how ambitious I am.  
  Even though at the beginning of this month I set a goal to learn and master **React** mainly this month, I still end up spending a considerable amount of time thinking about how to be able to **speak English like a professional**.  
  I know how much my time cost, but I still want to be truly good at what I'm capable of - English and be able to make value out of it.  
  With that being concerned, it does make sense to build and enhance the following skills:
- English writing and speaking
  - Recording Videos
  - Writing Blogs
  - Social Media
- Photo and video editing  
  **But** there has to be a **focus** in terms of what I truly want to share.

#### 3. Why should I stay focused?

Currently, if what I care is to be able to work as **a front-end engineer** with an English major background, what I truly need to think about is the requirement for a front-end engineer rather than the one for an English major. So here are the questions:

- **Why** do I want to work as a front-end engineer?
- What do I want to do with the skills I'm learning?  
  In the end, my goal is to be able to **enjoy my life**, and **make value** out of things I enjoy doing and find meaning from.  
  In this sense, I need to **be more focused**, because time is limited but skills are endless. I can only expect to excel in one aspect first then seek to achieve more.  
  So if I am serious about finding a job as soon as possible as a front-end engineer, I should work hard and attentively on learning and improving my **programming skills**. Anything else is merely distraction.  
  There's nothing wrong about sharing, but if you want to make good impact and truly benefit people with what you share, wait till you have **acquired the skills** that can make enough money to support yourself, wait till your **note** is good enough.

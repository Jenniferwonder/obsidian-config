9 Days Off [[2023-01-20]]-[[2023-01-28]]  
This is a lovely and memorable Spring Festival Holiday.  
Two years ago in Chinese New Year's Eve, Victor and I met for the first time and fell in love.  
In the same year, we got married.  
Till now, we've been together for two years.  
It's the first time we've been able to celebrate Chinese New Year in our hometowns with our family, thanks to the weakening virus.  
2023 is the year when my parents celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary and my grandpa celebrates his 80-year-old birthday.  
We've taken 9 days off with 8 days in Ganzhou with my family, which is lovely, and memorable.  
Mom prepared a big meal for us.  
We celebrated Grandpa's 80-year-old birthday. On that day, Mom made a birthday cake for grandpa and we sent him a red envelope with lucky money and bought him and grandma each a pair of shoes (39-42).

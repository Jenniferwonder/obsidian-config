## Scope
#### 1. Concepts
! Refers to the environment where a certain variable is declared;  
! JS => Lexical scoping which is defined by the placement of functions and blocks in the code  
! Scope of a variable: Refer to the entire region of code where a certain variable can be accessed  
! Child scope can access variables in its parent scope
#### 2. Three Types of Scope
- Function scope/ Local scope
- Global scope
- Block scope ES6
	- Eg. if/ for loops
	- let; const (not var)

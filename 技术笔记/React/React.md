## 核心知识
React, a JS library for building UIs. 
Developed at Facebook and released in 2013, it's safe to say that React has been the most influential UI library in recent memory [Fireship-as of 2020].  
We use it to build components that represent the logical and reusable parts of the UI. The beauty of React is that the simplicity of building a component has been brought down to its theoretical minimum. It's just a JS function.
The return value from this function is the HTML or UI which is written in a special syntax called `JSX`, allowing you to easily combined JS with HTML markup. If you wanna pass data into a component, you simply pass in a `prop` argument which you can reference inside the function body or in the UI using braces. If the value changes, React will react to update the UI. (React reacts to changes) 
If we want to give our components its internal state, we can use the `useState` hook. The hook is just a function that returns a value as well as a function to change the value.

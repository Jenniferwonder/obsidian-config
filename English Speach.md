### How to improve effective?
#### 1. Recording video?
Speaking depends heavily on active memory, but apparently there's **limited** English vocabulary and expressions stored in my active memory which I can apply smoothly without thinking about the **grammar and word choices** issues. 
When recording a video in English, it emphasizes a lot on **fluency** and our way of delivering the message. It films out everything showing in the camera, like our **facial expressions, postures and gestures**. But when we still facing struggles with word choices and grammar issues, how is it possible for us to speak in a fluent and comfortable way. 
If we still try to pursue fluency and no mistakes in this case, it often becomes a **repetitive work**. 
We start to force our brain to remember and output an exact script through repeating and that's when the talk starts to become less spontaneous and more like an acting. 
What do we get from this process? 
If what we repeat is truly a **proper and authentic** way of English speaking, that's fine. But is it? **More often,** we are repeating some mistakes or imperfections we don't even recognize at that time, and the more we repeat them, the harder it becomes to correct them later. They as we wish through repeating do become our first word choice, something we can speak out without a second thought. But it's a nightmare for improvements.
So how to prevent the unwanted results? We need to first make sure our brain know clearly what we have done right and what not before it starts repeating, so it can **repeat the right thing and correct the part that's not good enough**, so that we can truly make progress. Also, remember Rome is not built in one day. Making progress takes time. It takes **constant reflection and improvements**, which can hardly be achieved through sheer repeating. 
Think > Do > 
Reflect > 
Learn, Compare, Improve > 
Do Again, do more.
We have to work on other factors as well, like learning better ways of speaking through listening, **shadowing, retelling** and even reading and writing. Also, don't forget to **compare** them with our own way of speaking and **make adjustment** so that we know what we could have done better and how to do better next time. And most importantly, **apply** what we learned as often as possible and as soon as possible. 
Only after we apply the knowledge or skills we learned, can they become what we can truly use. And only by using the skills more often, can we use them more smoothly and comfortably.
## Output
### 2nd Complete Script
#### 1. Introduction
Hey guys! In this video, I wanna share with you **two effective and practical ways** to improve our spoken English. 
They are shadowing and retelling.  
With shadowing and retelling, even though we are not living in a foreign country where everybody speaks English, we can still learn authentic way of English speaking.
So how do they actually work?
Here's a speech deliverd by Steve Jobs at Stanford University. It's classic and instructive. How can we make the best use of this speech to do shadowing, retelling and finally improve our English?  
#### 2. Shadowing
This is how shadowing works. Shadowing means repeating the exact same words the speaker just said. By doing that, we can improve our pronunciation, because shadowing makes it easier for us to compare our pronunciation with the speaker's pronunciation so that we can make necessary adjustment to our pronunciation to make it sounds more natural and native.  
So all we need to do is to hit the 'play' button, then pause at some point and repeat the part you hear.~~, just like this ...~~  Try to use the exact same words, speed, tempo, intonation, gesture **and** even facial expression of the speaker, because that will help our brain **get the essence of** ~~all the tricks we need to know about~~ correct pronunciation.
OK. Let's have a try!
"It's an honor to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world."  
Do you get it? If you get stuck or forget some words in the speech, it's OK. Just replay the part <u>you're not sure about</u> until you can repeat it smoothly. 
#### 3. Retelling
Now let's see how retelling works. Retelling means using our own words to retell something we heard. 
Apparently, it's more challenging, 'cause we need to use our own words to reconstruct the information, **but** if we find any expressions or phrases useful, we can use them right away when we do retelling.    
Let's have a try. 
"..."  
So Steve Jobs just told us a truth about himself which is he never graduated from a college. Giving the speech was the closest he had ever been to a college graduation. In this speech, he wants to tell us three stories from his life. "That's it. No big deal." That's what he said
So here I notice and apply some useful phrases, expressions and sentence structures Steve uses in his speech, like "Truth be told" which we normally would say "To tell you a truth", "Honestly speaking", "To be honest", but it's retelling, so we can't use them, so I retell by saying "He told us a truth about himself." 
There're also **phrases** like "graduate from a college", "stories from my life", and the **closing expressions** like "No big deal. That's it.", and also the **sentence structure** like "the closest I've ever been to". 
Through retelling, we're able to use all of those nice phrases and expressions and truly remember them. Isn't it great?
#### 4. Conclusion
So this is how we can do shadowing and retelling to improve our spoken English. 
Thanks for your watching. See you next time. Bye!

#### 5. Retelling-Plus 
So are there any tricks we can use when doing retelling? The answer is yes. 
One is that we need use the correct person's perspective when doing retelling, but in most cases, we just need to change the first person's perspective to the third person's perspective. For example, if the speaker said "I never graduated from a college", when retelling, we can simply say 'he never graduated from a college'.  
Second, make sure to use the correct tense. This is a tricky part, which takes more practice. But usually, we just need to change the present tense to the past tense. For example, if the speaker said "This is the closest I have ever gotten to a college graduation", you can retell by saying "That was the closest he had ever gotten to a college graduation." 
If you want to retell a longer part of story and keep as many details as possible, you should take notes. More often than not, you need to replay the part of story until you feel ready to retell. There are some note taking strategies you can use, but it's out of the scope of this video, so maybe I'll show you in another video. 
Anyway, the golden trick of retelling is to pretend that you are retelling the part of information you heard to a real person. That way, our brain will figure out most of the things by itself. 
### 1st Complete Script
#### 1. Introduction
Hey guys! In this video, ~~I'm gonna.~~ I wanna share with you **two ways** I find truly effective and practical to improve our spoken English. They are shadowing and retelling.  
With shadowing and retelling, even though we don't have the chance to live in a foreign country to learn English from or don't have a language partner to practice English with, we can still improve our spoken English.  
Here's a speech deliverd by Steve Jobs at Stanford University. It's classic and instructive. How can we make the best use of this speech to do shadowing, retelling and finally improve our English?  
#### 2. Shadowing
First, let's see how shadowing works. Shadowing means repeating the exact same words the speaker just said. By doing that, we can improve our pronunciation, because shadowing makes it easier for us to compare our pronunciation with the speaker's pronunciation so that we can make necessary adjustment to our pronunciation to make it sounds more natural and native.  
So all we need to do is to hit the 'play' button, then pause at some point and repeat the part we hear, just like this ...  
"It's an honor to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world."  
Wow, I think I got it right. So try to use the exact same words, speed, tempo, intonation, gesture **and** even facial expression of the speaker, because that will help our brain get the essence of all the tricks we need to know about pronunciation. But if you get stuck or forget some words ~~when doing shadowing~~ in this process, it's OK. Just replay the part you're not sure about until you can repeat **without any words missing**. Remember the whole purpose is to let our brain get used to the correct way of speaking, right?  
#### 3. Retelling
So how does retelling work? Let's continue the speech, alright? ~~And I'm gonna show you how it works.~~  
"..."  
So Steve Jobs just told us a truth about himself which is he never graduated from a college. Giving the speech was the closest he had ever been to a college graduation. In this speech, he wants to tell us three stories from his life. "No big deal. That's it." That's what he said.  
That's a way of retelling- to retell a part of speech or story in our own words. Apparently, it's more challenging, because you need to reconstruct the speech in  your own words, **but** it gives us a chance to apply what we learned immediately, which is helpful in building our ability to use more precise words and better expressions in our own speaking.  
Here are some tricks I find helpful in retelling.  
One is that you can simply change the first person's perspective to the third person's perspective. For example, if the speaker said "I never graduated from a college", when retelling, we can say 'he never graduated from a college'.  
Second, make sure to use the correct tense. For example, if the speaker said "This is the closest I have ever gotten to a college graduation", you can retell by saying "That was the closest he had ever gotten to a college graduation." Usually, we just need to change the present tense to the past tense.  
You can just imagine that you are actually retelling something you heard to a real person.  
#### 4. Conclusion
So **to wrap it up**, if you wanna improve your spoken English, try shadowing and retelling. You will find them truly helpful **along the way**.

### 1st Draft
~~**Speaking of** spoken English, <u>I'm pretty sure many of you understand how important</u> it is, especially if you are an English major, because **truth be told**, spoken English has become the most crucial and direct aspect for people to judge from how good our English is.  
But we all find it hard to improve.  
We face the same problem like we don't have any proper **language partner** to practice English with or it's hard to find one. We live in an **environment** where everybody speaks Chinese and it feels hard to set up a so-called language environment for us to improve English.  
So are there any better and more pratical ways? Yes, there are. We can do **shadowing and retelling**.~~  
~~But with shadowing and retelling, we can effectively improve spoken English by ourselves.~~  
**Shadowing** means repeat the part of speech we just heard as precisely as possible; while **retelling** means retell either the part of speech or the whole speech we just heard in our own words, retaining as much authentic information as possible.  
**Shadowing** is of great help in improving our pronunciation and **retelling** is specially helpful with our application of the ~~advanced or native~~ expressions and vocabulary we just heard. Let's see how they actually work.  
~~I know many of you may have heard about these two ways before, but let me show you how I use them to practice and improve spoken English, so that you know how they actually work.~~  
You get the point.  
We live in an environment where everybody speaks Chinese.  
English is always this plus nice-to-have skill in our resume. But when we do need it, we always find that we are not good enough. We can not use it comfortably and fluently to express our thinking, or use it interact and communicate with people. Why?  
When can we end this vicious circle where everybody is pushed to invest a huge amount of time learning English but still being unable to speak English properly or not even taking any chance to actually use it?  
Pretty self-explanatory.
- Speak Englsih as often as possible.  
	- Be confident.
	- Don't be a perfectionist. 
- Record an audio or video of yourself speaking English.

## Useful Expressions
#### 1. Opening Remarks/ Topic
I'm honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world.  
**Truth be told** = to be honest/ to tell you the truth  
This is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.  
Today I wanna tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.
#### 2. First Story
The first story is about **connecting the dots**.  
I dropped out of Reed College after the first six months, but then stayed around as a **drop-in** for another 18 months **or so** before I really quit.  
So why did I **drop out**?  
**It started** before I was born.  
My biological mother was a young unwed graduate student, and she decided to **put me up** for adoption.  
She **felt very strongly that** I should be adopted by college gradutes, so everything **was all set** for me to be adopted by a lawyer and his wife, except when I popped out, they decided at the last minute that they wanted to have a girl. So my parents, who were **on a waiting list**, got a call in the middle of the night asking: 'We've got an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?" They said "Of course."  
My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduted from college and my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only **relented** later after my parents promised that I would go to college. This was the start in my life.  
And 17 years later, I **did** go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings **were being spent** on my college tuition. After 6 months, I couldn't see the **value** in it.  
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and no idea how college was going to help me figured it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved **their entire life**. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all **work out** OK.  
It was pretty scary at the time, but **looking back,** it was one of the best decisions I'd ever made. The minute I dropped out, I could stop taking the **required classes** that **didn't interest** me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.  
It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor  in friends' roooms. I returned coke bottles for 5 cents deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple.  
I loved it. And much of **what I stumbled into** by following my **curiosity** and **intuition** **turned out to be** priceless later on.  
Let me give you an example.  
Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus, every poster, every label on every drawer was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take the calligraphy classes to learn how to do this.  
I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, and artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.  
None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography.  
If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would never drop in on that calligraphy class and personal computer might not have the wonderful typography that they do.  
Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college, but it was very clear looking backwards 10 years later. Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in the future. You have to trust something, your **gut, destiny, life, karma,** whatever. Because believing that the dots would connect down the road, it'll give you the confidence to **follow your heart,** even when it **leads you off the well-worn paths**. And that will **make all the difference**. [5:42]

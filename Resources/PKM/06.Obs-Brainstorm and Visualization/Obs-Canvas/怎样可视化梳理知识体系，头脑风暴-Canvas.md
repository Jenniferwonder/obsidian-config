- ? How can I visually map out everything in my mind and link to notes?  
- I wanted to have a quick review of everything I have done and map out what I possibly need to do visually. 
## Canvas Review
The canvas plugin - `Canvas Node?` enabled me to automatically relink my canvas cards based on the shortest route. And I set a hotkey for this function: `Alt Shift C`.  
I created a *Project Overview* canvas- [[Front-End Projects Overview.canvas]] 
- ! But it's still rather time-consuming for me to edit on canvas.  
I had to switch between my mouse and keyboard constantly when editing on canvas. I haven't find any ways that can enable me to add card like in Mindmap with hotkeys.  
Are there any better ways to use canvas?  
I haven't figured out yet. #todo

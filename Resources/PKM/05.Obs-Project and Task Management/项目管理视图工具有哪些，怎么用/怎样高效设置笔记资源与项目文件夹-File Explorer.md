- ? How can I track, organize, modify and use my notes in a more efficient and valuable way? 
## Project Folder and Notes Rebuild
Then, I realized to review in a more efficient way, it's of utmost necessity to review the notes I have already created. But my notes are stored in different folders, not visually trackable and editable and not in an actionable atom pieces, even the graph view seems like a giant web mess. A new question popped out:

I re-organized my project folder into `GeekEnglish` by referring to the [[Ultimate Productivity System-CODE|CODE-Framework]] and note refactor, zettelkasten method.

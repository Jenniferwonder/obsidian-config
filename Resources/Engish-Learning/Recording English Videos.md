## Reflection and Script 
Why do I so desperately want to improve my English speaking and writing?
What's the point of learning a language if we can't even find a chance to use that language properly or to communicate with people who speak that language?
Why do I fail to **speak fluently and naturally** like other popular video bloggers in recording videos? 
Why do I blink my eyes and move my body so much when I speak in front of a camera?
- Is it because I don't know the words or expressions they used? Obviously no. I have no trouble understanding anything they are saying.
- The tricky thing about recording videos is that it is not as easy as talking to a real person but you have to look like talking to a real person. 
- When we are talking to a real person we'll get instant response and feedback which makes it easier for us to give further response or add something new, but when recording videos, we don't get any instant response or feedback, we have to keep talking on the topic based on what we know or prepare. If there's any unnecessary hesitation or pause, it'll ruin the audience's experience of watching your video or listening to your speaking. The same thing is true in real conversation. 
What hinders my way of speaking?
- My mind is constantly correcting on what I'm saying and it's telling me to better make no mistakes
- I'm trying to speak flawlessly and also being too critical
- I put so much pressure on myself to speak accurately, naturally and fluently?
- I'm always the biggest critic of myself which may help me find where I can improve but may also bring doubts and hesitation to me when I'm speaking
- I think too much while speaking
- I'm not confident enough about my speaking 
- I'm not sure about what I'm trying to say
- There's lack of **word fluency and choices** in my speaking, but I just need to accept that imperfection when I'm already speaking.
- There's lack of practice in terms of **deep and logical thinking** which has nothing to do with which language we use
How should I overcome the problems I have in speaking?
- Accept imperfections and mistakes
- Focus on the **content** we trully want to deliver
- Don't invest time and energy in figuring out the perfect approprite words or expressions
When and how can we improve the accurary and efficiency of our speaking?
- Reflect on the videos we have recorded
- Note down the problems we need to overcome and find out the reasons that lead to those problem 
- Figure out how we can do better
- Learn from pros
- Get used to better word choices and better ways of speaking 
#### 1. Record video?
##### 1.1. Why recording a video in English is hard?
Speaking depends heavily on our **active memory**, so if we find it hard to speak smoothly, **apparently** it's because there's **limited** English vocabulary and expressions stored in our active memory, which is different from regular memory, which means we may remember and understand a lot of words, expressions and sentence structures in terms of listening and reading, but we may still find it hard to use them in speaking and writing, because they are not in our active memory.  
~~which we can apply without thinking about the **grammar and word choices** issues.~~  
When recording a video in English, it emphasizes a lot on **fluency** and our way of delivering the message. It films out everything showing in the camera, like our **facial expressions, postures and gestures**. But when we still facing struggles with word choices and grammar issues, how is it possible for us to speak in a fluent and comfortable way?  
##### 1.2. Why shouldn't we pursue fake fluency? 
If we try to pursue fluency and no mistakes **in that case**, the video we are trying to record often becomes a **repetitive memory work**.  
We start to force our brain to remember and output an exact script through repeating and that's when the talk starts to become less spontaneous and more like an acting.  
##### 1.3. How to avoid repeating mistakes?
If what we repeat is truly a **proper and authentic** way of English speaking, that's fine. But is it? **More often,** we are repeating some mistakes or imperfections we don't even recognize at that time, and the more we repeat them, the harder it becomes to correct them later. They as we wish through repeating do become our first word choice, something we can speak out without a second thought. But it's a nightmare for improvements.  
So how to prevent the unwanted results? We need to first make sure our brain know clearly what we have done right and what not before it starts repeating, so it can **repeat the right thing and correct the part that's not good enough**, so that we can truly make progress. Also, remember Rome is not built in one day. Making progress takes time. It takes **constant reflection and improvements**, which can hardly be achieved through sheer repeating. 
##### 1.4. How to truly improve spoken English?
We have to work on other factors as well, like learning better ways of speaking through listening, **shadowing, retelling** and even **reading and writing**. 
Also, don't forget to **compare** them with our own way of speaking and **make adjustment** so that we know what we could have done better and how to do better next time. 
And most importantly, **apply** what we learned as often and soon as possible.  
Only after we apply the knowledge or skills we learned, can they become what we can truly use. Only by using the skills more often, can we use them more smoothly and comfortably.

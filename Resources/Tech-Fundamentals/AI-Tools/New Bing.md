## Intro

Hello, this is Jennifer. Today just as I was about to seriously explore the power of ChatGPT, I saw new Bing intro page.  
![[zz-assets/Pasted image 20230404135913.png]]  
I was so excited to be able to use ChatGPT inside new Bing and guess what? It truly blow my mind, but I should add at first, because as I DateStarted to seriously compare it with traditional search engine and other content platform, I realized its limit and the potential risks for us to rely on it sorely.

## How does it work?

### ChatBot UI - 用户界面

At first glance, new Bing looks just like a traditional search engine with a search bar. But on the top right corner, there's a new chat icon. We can click it to access the ChatBot and start asking questions in the **chat box**.  
But the better way is to enter our question directly in the search bar. Then ChatGPT will provide us with answers on the right side of **the result page**. If we scroll up, we'll be able to use the chatbot in **full page mode**. If we want to go back to the traditional result page, we just need to scroll down.

### Will ChatBot replace traditional search engine? - 会替代传统搜索引擎吗？

Traditionally, we'll get a list of results that we have to choose from and will have to click open many to get all the information we need.  
And chances are we'll have to also scroll through some **ads** that are trying to get our attention.  
Even when we find the target websites, we'll have to wait for them to respond and find information from a bunch of irelevant sources and will probably have to see other **ads** in those websites.  
Today, with tools like ChatGPT, we'll immediately get the fully summarized information we need and even its source links all in one place which saves us tremendous amount of time and it provides with us a much **cleaner and natural** way to get information.  
Even better, we can choose to keep asking **further questions** based on our chat history or clear the history to start anew.  
So now all we need to do is to just have an ultimate goal in our mind, and ask any questions we have in order to achieve the goal.

### Risks of Relying on ChatBot Solely? - 风险提示

Make sure to double check.

### User experience - 实战体验？

For me, I am currently trying to build a **quiz website** with React, in order to enhance my understanding about React and learn about other necessary tech skills to build the website. Let's see how new Bing can help me achieve the goal.

#### 1. How to build a quiz website?

I DateStarted by asking "How to build a quiz website?"  
This is what I got from the ChatBot.  
Later I tried asking the same question in Chinese and got a different answer from mostly Chinese sources. But when I asked it again, it doesn't work and suggests me to ask in English.  
So this is the hard truth we have to accept - it performs better in English.

#### 2. How to build a quiz website with React?

Since I want to enhance my knowledge about React, I ask more specificly "..."?

#### 3. Do I need to set up a database for my quiz website?

### Conclusion

Obviously, I can keep asking questions about **database** or anything I'm not sure about to finally get a clear picture about what I need to do to finally build the website.  
Tools like ChatGPT is definitely a game changer for how we get information and solve problems. It's definitely worth to rethink our way of working and how we can make better use of AI-powered tools to make our life easier.  
I truly hope that one day we'll have our own Chinese ChatBot as good as ChatGPT or even better.

A hard truth we have to accept is that it performs better when the question is asked in English. And you know what, it generates different answers from different language souces for the same question asked in different languages. So if the question is asked in Chinese, it generates answer mostly from Chinese websites, and vice versa.  
but I still have a bunch of questions about the project  
To use ChatGPT to its fullest potential, it's important to at least know what problem we want to solve. The clearer our goal and purpose is, the better results we'll get.

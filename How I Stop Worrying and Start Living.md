## Reflection
#### 1. Learn to appreciate
It's good to have a goal or an ideal picture of our lives, because it is often what drives us to make our lives better.  
But with that, be prepared to handle stress, setbacks, doubts or even the feeling of being less satisfied. Those are malicious enemies trying to distract us from noticing and **appreciating** for what we've already had and prevent us from achieving what we want.  
#### 2. Stay positive
So long as we hope to achieve more, we'll inevitably hit obstacles and setbacks, and then feel worried, anxious, or even frustrated and painful.  
What we can do and should do is to always **stay positive and have faith** that things will work out just fine.The power of human life lies in its resilience. We have the strength and resilience to live a way through.  As the saying goes "Things that don't kill us make us stronger." Ups and downs are what make our lives full of meaning.  
#### 3. Take a rest
Sometimes we can't help but feeling frustrated towards achieving our goals. It's OK. Just don't be trapped in it. Take it as a sign to take a rest. Don't ever feel bad about ourselves or doubt our capabilities. Do what we can do. Take a rest, and have a good sleep. The next day, we'll be a brand new person. Our faith will be back and the future is still hopeful.  
I love the poem [The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken) 
>Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”  
>I took the one less traveled by,  
>And that has made all the difference.

There are two roads and sorry you could not travel both. Sure each road has its own beauty, but you've made your choice to take one instead of the other, you have to take the cost as well and appreciate for what you have and where you are.  
As stated in the quote "**Whereever you are, be there.** That's a key to happiness.

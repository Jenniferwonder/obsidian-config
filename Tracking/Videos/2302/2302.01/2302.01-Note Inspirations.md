## Unused Script

~~What's the purpose of me spending so much time and efforts learning English, from undergraduate school to postgraduate school and then ending up being a teacher teaching students how to pass English exams?~~  
~~- I start to really take advantage of English to get authentic information, to learn skills from excellent resources, to reach out to a bigger world.~~

- ~~To be a qualified front-end engineer, there are tons of things to learn.~~
- I had constantly asked myself- What's the purpose of spending so much time and efforts in learning English? Why are there so many Chinese programmars so desparately wanting to improve their English as much as me wanting to learn programming? There got to be a link between English and programming.
- So if you are also thinking about making a career shift to front-end engineering, you'd better be prepared to embrace the challenge.  
  ~~- The market of Internet and Technology is more competitive than we think. There are tons of smart people out there aiming to stand out and get in one of the big tech companies. You need to seriously ask yourself "Am I ready and willing to take all the possible challenges and invest a decent amount of time to get into this new career?"~~
-
- You need to be prepared to accecpt the fact that
- in one of the big tech company. you're going to face in this new
- from an universally acknowleged underpaying job to one that has more growing opportunities.
- It's indeed challenging but it offers me a chance to really use English to learn something other than English.
- Because I believe the value of English is more than teaching students how to achieve high scores in English exams.
- I majored in English and had a postgraduate degree in English Translation. The capability to get authentic information and resources, to know different culture and learn everything in English has always brought me so much joy and fulfillment. I'm big fan of learning.
- But I had never realized that learning is a priviledge and a way of enjoying convenience provided by people who contribute the knowlege, until I became a teacher.
- Helping students learn what you learned is cool, which is also a way of enhancing our previous knowlege, isn't it?
- But what if you'll be mostly valued by the scores your students achieve in an English exam. ~~So you'd better forget about leaning anything else in English other than how to help your students better pass exams.~~
- We were trained to achieve high scores in exams since we were students and now that becomes what we are good at.
- Even though we know that's not the best way of learning, we kind of get stuck in this way. Everything is all set to this path.
- As a teacher, it's always disappointing to see our students as senior high school students still misbehave in class whether it's sleeping, eating, chatting or not following our instructions. It's easy to say that they are trouble makers. They lack of discpline. But probably they are simply showing us "I give up" or more likely just "I'm not interested". Students today are smart and have their own thinking.
- As a teacher, you have two ways to solve the problem: one, change your teaching styles and try to teach in a way that all your students are willing to be involved, but you know how hard and technically impossible it is given the number of students and time you have and so many things you have to deal with; Second, persuade your students to stop their misbehaviors. But then you will get stuck in a way that neither of you feel happy about.
- I respect all my teachers who sacrifice their interest to figure out the best way for us to achieve high scores in exams. But what about real application of English? What's the purpose of spending so much time and efforts learning English? Is learning and teaching students how to pass English exams the only value of English major? Sure not.
- English is more than that. Life is more than that. There's a big world out there and English, is an international language. Why don't we take advange of it to learn something really interesting and powerful, to grow our skills, grow the boundary of our life?
- So last year after my first class of students graduated, I decided to pursue something new, to learn what I feel is powerful-Coding with the power of English.
- ~~Teaching students how to take English exams has seemingly become a doomed fate for English majors who end up being English teachers.~~
- ~~But I've never been aboad and never been able to am an English major and used to be an English teacher, but I've never been abroad. I always appreciate the different way of thinking and different perspectives English has brought to me and now I get to spend all my time leaning what I'm passionate about.~~

# Class-based/ Classical OOP
## Reference

## OOP Principles
#### 1. Abstraction
- Hide the details and show the essentials
#### 2. Inheritance
- JS-constructors- [[Object]]
- JS-prototype chain-[[Prototype Inheritance]]
	- The prototype chain's behavior is less like inheritance and more likeÂ **delegation**.
- JS-[[ES6 Class]]
	- a syntac sugar
	- not a new way of combining objects
	- just a way to make it easier to set up a prototype chain
- Class-based OOP
#### 3. Encapsulation
#### 4. Polymorphism
- when a method has the same name but a different implementation in different classes
